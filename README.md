ðŸŽ§ Spotify Clone â€“ Built with HTML, CSS & JavaScript ðŸš€

Excited to share a front-end project I recently completed â€” a Spotify-inspired music player built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no backend involved).

This web app features core music player functionalities including play, pause, next, previous, volume control, and dynamic time updates, all powered by clean, efficient JavaScript. Iâ€™ve also integrated responsive design principles with media queries to ensure a seamless and intuitive experience across desktop and mobile devices.

Through this project, I:

 âœ… Understanding how arrays work to manage and cycle through song lists

 âœ… Enhanced my understanding of DOM manipulation and event listeners to bring the interface to life

 âœ… Writing clean, asynchronous code using async/await to ensure smooth user interactions

 âœ… Learned how JavaScript powers interactivity: managing audio playback, adjusting volume, updating progress bars based on song time, and handling events like next, previous, pause ðŸŽ¶

 âœ… Creating a responsive design using media queries for seamless mobile and desktop experience

This project significantly enhanced my practical understanding of JavaScript and front-end development.
